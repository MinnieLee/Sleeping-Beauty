                    Angelina Jolie makes a fabulous monster. As the title character in “Maleficent” — a divertingly
                    different rethink of an awfully old story — she breezes through the movie, part superstar, part
                    superfreak.

                    Her red mouth slashes across the screen while her clothes billow like storm clouds, her body framed
                    by enormous shimmering wings and her head capped by a pair of majestic horns. The wings allow her to
                    soar, but the horns mainly give her character a distinctly Freudian kink, some phallic enhancement
                    to go with the fairy tale enchantment. And, my, what big horns they are.

                    She wears them like a crown in this live-action postscript to the visually stunning 1959 Disney
                    animated musical “Sleeping Beauty.” This time, the focus isn’t on the beautiful, blond Aurora, who
                    falls into a deep, bewitched sleep after pricking her finger on a spindle, but rather on the
                    sinister scene stealer who cursed her in a fit of pique and a puff of acid-green smoke. As it turns
                    out, Maleficent (it rhymes with magnificent) had her reasons and a back story to go with them.
                    Soothingly introduced in voice-over by Janet McTeer, Maleficent’s story opens when she was a happy
                    young fairy (Isobelle Molloy and Ella Purnell) living in, and flying over, the moors, a lush,
                    computer-generated wonderland populated by cute uglies and delicately mossy, twiggy giants.
                    Trouble enters in the form of a human boy, Stefan, a farmhand who’s caught pilfering a stone, a
                    seemingly small act that reverberates as loudly as Klaxon horns. Maleficent forgives him; a
                    friendship is born; time rushes by — it’s obvious that the filmmakers can’t wait to bring in Ms.
                    Jolie — and the friendship evolves into a puppyish romance, sealed with a kiss. Stefan seems nice
                    enough, if bland, and he’s played first by Michael Higgins and then, briefly, by Jackson Bews.
                    Before long, though, Ms. Jolie has taken to the skies while, back in the human realm, Sharlto Copley
                    has brought the adult Stefan ploddingly, disappointingly down to earth. Casting is destiny in a lot
                    of movies; one look at the twitchy, shifty-eyed adult Stefan, and it’s clear that Mr. Copley won’t
                    be continuing the romance.
                    He doesn’t. Instead, he betrays Maleficent and, in one of the movie’s muddled sections, helps wage
                    war against her land. Her wings literally clipped, Maleficent retreats into her dark place like a
                    grounded Valkyrie, casting shadows over her world to go with her mood. Stefan assumes the throne
                    and, years later, he and his forgettable queen have a child, Aurora.
                    At this point, the filmmakers pick up the “Sleeping Beauty” thread and begin weaving it into
                    Maleficent’s story, so, again, there are a christening and a curse, and Aurora is squired away by a
                    troika of pixies (a tolerably amusing Imelda Staunton, Lesley Manville and Juno Temple), who raise
                    her in a forest cottage. There, she grows up (and eventually into Elle Fanning) under the gaze of
                    Maleficent, which is where this rethink gets going.

                    In broad strokes, “Maleficent” is Disney’s latest bid to recast a dusty story for a contemporary
                    audience, one that has, over the years, complained with good reason about the company’s
                    representations, particularly of female characters. For decades, Disney has responded with an array
                    of plucky girls and women whose desires extend beyond romantic longing. Usually, they have
                    adventures, and not just dreams, to go with their wasp waists and froufrou. Sometimes they save the
                    day and their true love, which is better and more fun than waiting to be saved. Yet Disney heroines,
                    whether princesses or not, have almost always ended up as reliably paired off as if they were
                    boarding Noah’s ark. A notable exception is Queen Elsa in “Frozen,” a very different kind of
                    heroine.

                    That Elsa remains single in “Frozen” has inspired some widely, wildly divergent readings of that
                    movie, with some commentators claiming her as a L.G.B.T. representation, and others denouncing her
                    for the same reason. It’s entirely possible that “Maleficent,” partly because it’s narratively weak
                    and Ms. Jolie is a powerful screen presence, will inspire its share of warring interpretations (and
                    dismissals). The movie, directed by Robert Stromberg from Linda Woolverton’s script, draws on
                    Disney’s “Sleeping Beauty” and Charles Perrault’s version of the tale. Despite this, the narrative
                    linchpin isn’t Aurora: It’s Maleficent, who doesn’t fit the fairy tale template largely because of
                    her relationships. Stefan angers her, but she so gets over him and soon shifts her attention
                    elsewhere.

                    Mr. Stromberg, a production designer making his feature directing debut, does best when he scales
                    down, as in the lovely shots of Maleficent walking next to a floating, unconscious Aurora, an image
                    that telegraphs more about their relationship than any line of dialogue. The action scenes, by
                    contrast, are visually uninteresting, borderline generic and unnecessary. There are also far too
                    many long shots when the digital renderings (especially those with human figures) pull you out of
                    the story instead of keeping you immersed. But there’s so much to look at in the movie — from the
                    wittily designed creatures to the shocks of bilious green and purple — that the battles quickly
                    fade. (The colors are, as is a galloping race to the rescue, among the many nods to the 1959
                    “Sleeping Beauty.”)
                    Ms. Jolie is, unsurprisingly, a visual marvel. Her face has been smoothed into an alabaster Cubist
                    mask, and prostheses elongate her already sharp cheekbones; from some angles, it looks as if she had
                    a second set of vestigial wings riding under her skin. The exquisite attention to detail in both the
                    makeup and costume is routine in major productions like this one, of course, but the mixture of Old
                    Hollywood glamour and contemporary fetishwear doesn’t just turn Maleficent into a pleasurable
                    spectacle, it also serves a character who embodies both the past and the future. Ms. Jolie’s
                    performance is similarly bifurcated, with a controlled physicality that, just when it seems to be
                    edging into catwalk blankness, springs to weird life with grotesque facial contortions and spidery
                    movements.

                    Bruno Bettelheim, that great reader of fairy tales, saw “The Sleeping Beauty” as a story of sexual
                    awakening. She wakes only when physically and emotionally mature enough, when she is ready for love
                    and its familiar handmaidens: sex and marriage. It’s at that point, Bettelheim writes in “The Uses
                    of Enchantment,” “the wall of thorns suddenly turns into a wall of big, beautiful flowers, which
                    opens to let the prince enter.” That’s quite the metaphor, but for women, it has sometimes also been
                    a curse, including in movies, where they have traditionally had to wait for a man to get them to
                    their happily ever after. There’s no denying the attractions of that narrative for some of us: Even
                    Lena Dunham got swept off her feet.

                    But, come on! There’s more to life and certainly more to women, which is something that, however
                    imperfectly, “Maleficent” grapples with. I’m still not sure if the movie’s smack-down between
                    patriarchy and matriarchy is the way to go, but at least nobody here is warbling about what she
                    wants before hitting the road to self-actualization.
                    Consciously or not, coherently or not, “Maleficent” tells a new kind of story about how we live now,
                    not once upon another time. And it does so by suggesting, among other things, that budding girls and
                    older women are not natural foes, even if that’s what fairy tales, Hollywood and the world like to
                    tell us. And while that may sound drippy, it’s exactly the kind of hokey that, movie by movie, may
                    finally make a real difference.

                    “Maleficent” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). There is some bloodless violence, some
                    involving wings.
